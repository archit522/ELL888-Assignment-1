Multilayer Perceptron and Feed Forward Neural Network is used to classify hand written digits dataset.
Changes in Convergence and Performance have been seen through -
1. Single Hidden Layer and Multiple Hidden Layer Feed Forward Network
2. Lasso(L1) and Ridge(L2) Regression
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
4. Batch Normalization
5. Dropout Layer
